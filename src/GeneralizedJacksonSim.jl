"""
Runs a discrete event simulation of an Open Generalized Jackson Network `net`.

The simulation runs from time `0` to `max_time`.

Statistics about the total mean queue lengths are recorded from `warm_up_time` onwards
and the estimated value is returned.

This simulation does NOT keep individual customers' state, it only keeps the state which is
the number of items in each of the nodes.
