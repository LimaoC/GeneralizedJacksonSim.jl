    "- Amusement park attractions usually serve multiple people simultaneously, whereas the model assumes jobs can only be serviced one at a time\n",
    "- People may cut in line and skip queues, so in reality it is not really a queue in the first-in, first-out (FIFO) sense\n",

    "Model assumptions that are unrealistic for the application of a theme park:\n",
    "- Assuming that queues (and by extension the theme park) have infinite capacity\n",
    "- Assuming that people will unconditionally stay in a queue until they get to the front of the line - they may leave because the queue is too long, they want to go to another attraction, etc.\n",
    "- Assuming that the time taken to move between attractions or leave the theme park is instant, as travelling between attractions takes time\n",
    "- Service duration is independent from all other services - if people are at the theme park together as a party (e.g. a family travelling around the theme park), their service durations will not be independent from each other\n",
    "- Arrival of jobs to nodes is exponentially distributed\n",
