    "Due to the low quality of audio, this paragraph is in response to Dr Foeglein’s 2021 seminar: <br>\n",
    "Dr Anna Foeglein knew that she wanted to be involved in simulation since she was a child, her interest being piqued when her mother brought home a computer. Anna studied a maths degree, majoring in pure mathematics and making some substantial contributions in her thesis that are still used today. Anna worked at the university for a while however was less interested in the tutoring aspect than she was in the software used to input and calculate students’ grades. She worked at simulation group for around 10 years before moving to the Integrated Logistics Company and AnyLogic where she currently works. She spends approximately 20% of her time selling software with AnyLogic, and the other 80% is spent working with the coal industry running simulations and models to organise coal shipment and delivery. <br>\n",
    "There were many tools Dr Foeglein mentioned throughout her seminar including more code-based tools such as Simpy and SLX as well as more graphically based tools such as Jamsim. Even tools such as MATLAB Simulink are used, and which I found interesting given my current experience of MATLAB in mathematics courses at UQ. <br>\n",
    "An interesting tip that I picked up from Anna’s talks are key things to form a good mathematical question, these things include being linked to a decision as well as an organisations goals, and being bounded, specific, and quantifiable. This links strongly to the concept of ‘mathematising’ that Anna introduced, an intriguing concept that means translating a regular question into one that can be mathematically answered.\n"

    "**Test 2**: the code for test 2 can be found in `test/task3_test2.jl`. In order to record the number of arrivals $A_i(t)$, we added an `arrivals` field to the `QueueNetworkState` struct. So at the end of the simulation, the `state` will be populated with the total number of arrivals to each node, and we can access this through `state.arrivals`. However, we need to be able to have a reference to `state` from outside the `sim_net()` function to be able to calculate the simulated mean number of arrivals in the test. One solution is to have `sim_net()` return the mean number of arrivals as well, but this isn't really a clean solution and breaks compatibility with previous tests and scripts that rely on `sim_net()` only returning one float (total mean queue length). A better solution would be to add `state` as a keyword argument to `sim_net()`:\n",
